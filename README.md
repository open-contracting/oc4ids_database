To open a notebook from a different branch, use Colab's [Github browser](https://colab.research.google.com/github/open-contracting/oc4ids_database/) to choose the notebook and branch you want to open.

Alternatively, you can use the Open in Colab browser extension ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-in-colab/)) to add a button that, when clicked when viewing a Jupyter notebook on github, will open that notebook in Colab.
